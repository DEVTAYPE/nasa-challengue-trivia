      "What is the name of the male flower of corn, which produces the pollen?",
    options: ["Tassel", "Silk", "Husk", "Cob"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Very good! The tassel is that branched structure that grows at the top of the corn stalk, releasing the pollen that will then fall on the female flower (the ear).",
      "The 'silk' refers to the hairs (stigmas) that emerge from the ear and whose sole function is to capture pollen, not produce it.",
      "The husk is the popular name we give to the leaves that wrap and protect the ear of corn.",
      "The cob is the internal axis of the ear, which holds the kernels.",

    question:
      "What is the main function of the 'silk' or stigmas that emerge from the ear of corn?",
    options: [
      "To capture pollen for fertilization",
      "To protect the kernel from the sun",
      "To transport water from the stalk",
      "To aid in the plant's respiration",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Exactly! Each thread of the silk is connected to an ovule, and its job is to catch a grain of pollen coming from the tassel. If it is not pollinated, that ovule will not become a kernel.",
      "That is the function of the husk, which is the layer of leaves that covers the ear.",
      "Water is transported through the xylem in the stalk and the cob, not through the silk.",
      "The leaves are the main pathway for gas exchange and respiration.",

    options: ["Emergence", "Flowering", "Maturity", "Grain filling"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Correct! Emergence is when the seedling breaks the soil surface and is the first indicator that the seed has germinated successfully.",
      "This is a critical stage that occurs several weeks after emergence, when the plant is already large.",
      "It is the final stage, when the grain has completed its development and is ready for harvest.",

    options: ["Stalk", "Stolon", "Rhizome", "Bulb"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "That's the agronomic term! The corn stem is called a stalk and it is a robust, segmented structure.",
      "Stolons are creeping stems found on plants like strawberries that grow above the soil surface.",
      "Rhizomes are underground stems, as in ginger, not the aerial part of corn.",

      "Emergence",
      "Maturity",
      "Pre-planting",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Key knowledge! Corn needs the most water when it is forming and filling the ear. Water stress here drastically reduces the number and size of the kernels.",
      "While water is necessary, the plant can recover from mild stress in this initial phase with less impact on the final yield.",
      "At maturity, the grain has already formed. Lack of water only helps with drying.",
      "Moisture is needed for germination, but the maximum water demand is during the reproductive stage.",

      "Very alkaline (8.5 to 9.5)",
      "Extremely alkaline (9.5+)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "You got it! Corn prefers soils with a pH in this range, which ensures the best availability of essential nutrients like Phosphorus and Nitrogen.",
      "This pH can lead to aluminum toxicity and inhibit Phosphorus absorption, seriously damaging the corn.",
      "Such a high pH can cause micronutrient deficiencies like Zinc or Iron.",

      "Phosphorus (P)",
      "Potassium (K)",
      "Calcium (Ca)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "The champion of growth! Nitrogen is the main component of chlorophyll and proteins, so a deficiency immediately limits vegetative growth and causes general yellowing.",
      "Phosphorus is key for energy and roots, and its deficiency causes purple tones.",
      "Potassium helps with water regulation and resistance, and its deficiency is seen as scorching on the edges of old leaves.",
      "Calcium is a structural nutrient that affects the growth of new points, not the intensity of the green color.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Exactly! Corn is a proud member of the Grass or Poaceae family, just like wheat, rice, and sugarcane.",
      "This family includes crops like potatoes, tomatoes, and chili peppers.",
      "This family includes beans, lentils, and chickpeas, known for fixing nitrogen.",

    options: ["Cob", "Husk", "Silk", "Roots"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "You know it well! The cob is the core of the ear. Its function is to support the kernels as they grow and fill.",
      "The husk is the external protector, not the internal support structure.",
      "The silk are the hairs that allow for pollination.",

      "What pest is best known for attacking the central whorl of young corn, disrupting growth and causing the symptom known as 'deadheart'?",
    options: [
      "Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda)",
      "White Grub",
      "Aphid",
      "Whitefly",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "A serious problem! The Fall Armyworm attacks the tenderest growing point. Its damage is devastating, and it leaves the new leaf (the whorl) damaged before it unfurls.",
      "This grub focuses on roots and tubers, not the corn whorl.",
      "The aphid sucks sap from the leaves, but does not pierce or damage the whorl in the same destructive way as the armyworm.",
      "It is more of a problem of virus transmission, not mechanical damage to the growing point.",

    question:
      "What is the most characteristic symptom of water stress in corn at midday, even if there is surface moisture in the soil?",
    options: [
      "Rolling of the upper leaves (in a 'V' shape)",
      "Purplish-reddish coloration",
      "Yellowing of the lower leaves",
      "Necrosis on the edges of old leaves",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Good observation! When corn is stressed from lack of water, it rolls its upper leaves inward to reduce the surface area exposed to the sun and minimize water loss through transpiration.",
      "This is more associated with Phosphorus (P) deficiency.",
      "This is the typical symptom of Nitrogen (N) deficiency.",
      "This is a classic symptom of Potassium (K) deficiency.",

    question:
      "If data from NASA's GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) satellite shows a break in rainfall during the corn flowering stage, what is most likely to happen?",
    options: [
      "Pollination failure and loss of ovules (incomplete ears)",
      "Massive attack of Fall Armyworm",
      "Late blight due to excess moisture",
      "Improved Nitrogen absorption",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Accurate diagnosis! Pollination is very sensitive to drought and heat. Lack of water can sterilize pollen and prevent the silk (stigma) from being viable for fertilization, resulting in ears with missing kernels.",
      "Pests are related to weather conditions, but lack of rain directly impacts the plant's reproductive process.",
      "The GPM data indicates a lack of moisture, the opposite of what causes late blight.",
      "Nitrogen requires water to be absorbed and transported; drought reduces its absorption.",

    question:
      "The pest Spodoptera frugiperda (Fall Armyworm) is most destructive in the early stages of corn. What cultural management practice helps reduce its population in the field?",
    options: [
      "Planting resistant varieties or using trap plant barriers",
      "Hilling the plant",
      "Flood irrigation",
      "Foliar application of Potassium (K)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Smart preventive measure! Using corn varieties that have some natural resistance to the larva or planting bait plants to distract the pest is effective cultural management.",
      "Hilling protects the stalk and root, but the armyworm attacks the upper part of the plant.",
      "This practice has no direct effect on controlling the fall armyworm, and it wastes water.",
      "Potassium is nutritional, not insecticidal.",

      "What is the ideal planting time for corn in Andean regions so that flowering coincides with the season of highest humidity and lowest risk of early frosts?",
    options: [
      "Beginning of the rainy season (November-December)",
      "Middle of the dry season (June-July)",
      "End of the rainy season (March-April)",
      "Any month, corn is resilient",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Correct calendar! Planting at the beginning of the rains ensures that the critical phase of flowering and grain filling coincides with the period of maximum water availability.",
      "Planting in the dry season is very risky and requires full irrigation; it is not the ideal period.",
      "If you plant late, maturity could be reached during the peak of early frosts, which is fatal for the grain.",

      "Increase in the rate of photosynthesis",
      "Attraction of moths (Spodoptera frugiperda)",
      "Blockage in Nitrogen absorption",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Critical point! Young corn seedlings are very susceptible to low temperatures. A temperature of 0°C or less can freeze their tissues, causing irreversible damage.",
      "Extreme cold stops photosynthesis, it does not increase it.",
      "Cold usually reduces insect activity.",

    options: ["Nitrogen (N)", "Phosphorus (P)", "Potassium (K)", "Sulfur (S)"],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "The most classic symptom! Nitrogen is mobile in the plant, so the plant moves it from old leaves (lower) to new ones (upper), causing this 'V' shaped yellowing on the oldest leaves.",
      "Causes purple tones on old leaves.",
      "Causes scorching or necrosis on the edges of old leaves, not the yellow 'V'.",

      "Root Aphid",
      "Fall Armyworm",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Root diagnosis! The Wireworm is the most common and dangerous soil pest, as it pierces and destroys roots, causing a major problem with anchoring and absorption.",
      "Attacks the leaves and stems, not the roots.",
      "Although it exists, the Wireworm is much more destructive and well-known in corn.",

      "Excessive rain during emergence",
      "Increased attack from Fall Armyworm",
      "Potassium (K) deficiency",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "A costly mistake! Late planting pushes maturation into the colder months. If an early frost hits the grain while it's still moist, it can ruin the harvest.",
      "Rain is more likely at the beginning of the season.",
      "The Armyworm is more active at the beginning of the cycle, not the end.",

      "Nitrogen deficiency",
      "Drought stress",
      "Reduced transpiration rate",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Cause and effect! Corn roots need oxygen to respire. If the soil is saturated with water for too long, oxygen is depleted, and the roots suffocate and rot.",
      "Although waterlogging can cause Nitrogen losses, the immediate and lethal risk to the plant is root rot.",
      "The opposite problem. Poor drainage means excess water.",

      "Phosphorus (P) deficiency",
      "Increase in Wireworm attack",
      "Accelerated vegetative growth",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Critical temperature! Corn pollen dies or becomes unviable when temperatures exceed 35°C, preventing fertilization. This is a common cause of partially filled ears.",
      "High temperatures do not directly cause P deficiency.",
      "The Wireworm (root pest) is not related to air temperature.",

      "Applying the entire dose at planting",
      "Continuous foliar application",
      "Applying only organic manure",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Mastery in nutrition! Applying Nitrogen in several doses (splitting), especially one before planting and another at the V6-V8 stage (high growth), ensures the nutrient is available when the plant needs it most and minimizes losses from leaching.",
      "This is inefficient; much of the Nitrogen would be lost through washing or volatilization before the plant needs it in its peak demand phase.",
      "Foliar application is useful for quick micronutrient corrections, but it's not the efficient way to meet the high Nitrogen demand of corn.",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Science-based decision! Irrigating when the moisture is around 50% of field capacity ensures that the corn has enough available water (Readily Available Water) without suffering severe stress or waterlogging.",
      "This would be a problem, as it indicates saturation and risk of root rot.",
      "High NDVI indicates the plant is healthy, but it doesn't tell you when it's about to be stressed from lack of water.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Expert reading! A sharp drop in NDVI at such a crucial stage indicates that the leaves are dying rapidly. This is often caused by the plant urgently mobilizing Nitrogen or Potassium from the old leaves to fill the grain.",
      "Excess irrigation would lead to root rot, but the drop in NDVI is a symptom of nutrient deficiency in the leaves.",
      "Frost causes a sudden drop, but in this case, nutritional deficiency is a common cause of accelerated senescence.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Vital role! Potassium regulates the opening and closing of stomata (water management) and is key in transporting sugars from the leaves to the grain. A good availability at this stage ensures the final weight of the grain.",

      "Grain filling (R2-R4)",
      "Emergence (V1)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Advanced management! Corn is more tolerant to mild water stress in its early vegetative phase. Restricting water a bit here can promote deeper root development without seriously compromising the ear.",
      "Deficit irrigation at flowering is catastrophic and causes massive yield losses.",

    question:
      "Flowering (R1) is approaching. GPM predicts 2 weeks without rain. SMAP is at 45% and NDVI is 0.88. What is the combined strategy to protect the yield?",
    options: [
      "Start immediate irrigation to raise SMAP to 65%, and apply foliar Potassium (K) to increase tolerance to water stress",
      "Apply only Nitrogen to maximize photosynthesis",
      "Wait 1 more week, as the NDVI is high",
      "Plow the field to reduce compaction",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Expert action! The NDVI is excellent, but the moisture (45%) and impending drought (GPM) are threats. Irrigation is vital. Potassium, being a water regulator, helps the stomata resist thermal stress during flowering.",
      "The NDVI is already high; the problem is water.",
      "This is risking the flowering stage. Water damage at R1 is catastrophic, time is crucial.",
      "Plowing before R1 is destructive to the roots and does not solve the need for water.",

      "Areas with low NDVI (0.4) are detected at stage V6. MODIS data indicates 38°C and the NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) is 0.05 (very low). What does the NDWI + MODIS combination indicate?",
    options: [
      "Severe water and thermal stress, the plant has closed its stomata to survive",
      "Severe Phosphorus (P) deficiency",
      "Massive fungal infection",
      "High yield potential",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Double critical alert! The high MODIS indicates extreme heat and the very low NDWI confirms that the plant is dehydrated and has closed its stomata to retain water, stopping growth.",
      "The heat and low NDWI point to water, not Phosphorus.",

      "What is the main difference that the NDWI (Water Index) brings to decision-making that the NDVI (Vegetation Index) does not offer?",
    options: [
      "The NDWI directly indicates the water content in the leaves, alerting to internal water stress before the NDVI drops",
      "The NDWI measures soil temperature (MODIS)",
      "The NDWI measures total biomass (same as NDVI)",
      "The NDWI measures accumulated precipitation (GPM)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Precise data! The NDWI is more sensitive to the internal moisture of the leaf. It shows stress before the damage is visible in the biomass (NDVI).",
      "The NDWI does not measure temperature.",
      "Both measure biomass, but the NDWI is better for water content.",

      "Apply insecticide for the Fall Armyworm",

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Risk management! SMAP at 90% (saturation) is dangerous. The priority is not to add water (there is already enough), but to mitigate the risk of root rot and the development of fungi from excess moisture.",
      "No more water should be added; the problem is the excess.",

    question:
      "If the MODIS LST rises to 37°C and the soil moisture (SMAP) is ideal (60%) during grain filling. What is the main limiting factor for yield?",
    options: [
      "Thermal stress that reduces grain weight and quality due to high respiration",
      "Lack of Nitrogen (N) and drop in NDVI",
      "Cellular dehydration (low NDWI)",
      "Wireworm attack",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "End of the harvest! High temperature, even if there is water (SMAP 60%), causes the corn to use its sugars for respiration instead of using them to fill the grain. This reduces the final grain weight (yield).",
      "With ideal SMAP, N absorption should be optimal; the problem is the temperature.",

    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Total loss! Both indices are almost nil. The plant is not green (NDVI) nor does it have water in its tissues (NDWI). The stress is irreversible.",
      "Natural senescence occurs at R6, not at V12.",

      "It is used to decide the dose of Potassium (K)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Precision irrigation! OpenET tells you exactly how much water was lost, allowing you to apply only that amount, which saves water and fertilizers (since they are not 'washed away' with the excess).",
      "NDVI is better for estimating yield. OpenET is for water.",
      "MODIS LST is used for thermal stress or insect activity, not Evapotranspiration.",

      "The advanced NDVI (0.85) correlates with a GPM of 5mm of daily rain for a week. The farmer asks you if he should irrigate. What is the expert decision?",
    options: [
      "Do not irrigate, as precipitation is covering the high demand of the healthy plant (NDVI 0.85)",
      "Irrigate immediately to ensure surface moisture",
      "Apply a preventive fungicide due to excess moisture",
      "Increase nitrogen fertilization",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    optionExplanations: [
      "Climate management! A very healthy plant (high NDVI) has a high water demand (ETc). If GPM indicates that the rain is sufficient to cover that demand, artificial irrigation would be redundant and unnecessarily expensive.",
      "The rain already provides surface moisture.",
      "A 5mm rain is ideal, not excessive. Excess moisture is more concerning with a SMAP at 90.",

    options: [
      "The farmer has not irrigated correctly; the high moisture comes from a single massive irrigation (low OpenET), which stressed the plant (low NDWI)",
      "The field has severe drought, the rain was insufficient",

    optionExplanations: [
      "Historical evaluation! The SMAP is high (75%) which seems good, but the plant is stressed (low NDWI) and it has not rained (GPM 0). This suggests a recent massive irrigation (high SMAP), but the plant has not yet recovered from the previous stress, or the excess water caused temporary damage to the roots.",
